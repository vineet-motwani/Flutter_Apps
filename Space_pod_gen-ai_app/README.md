## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

After installing flutter, clone the project and run ```flutter pub get``` in your terminal. This installs all the dependencies required.
Then you can run the command ```flutter run --debug``` to test the application in debug mode.
